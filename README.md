We want to cluster observations so that similar observations are grouped together, If you know that you have k groups, you can use k-means clustering to group similar observations and
output a new feature containing each observation’s group membership We are jumping ahead of ourselves a bit and will go much more in depth about clustering algorithms
later in the book. However, I wanted to point out that we can use clustering as a preprocessing step.
Specifically, we use unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means to cluster observations into groups.
The end result is a categorical feature with similar observations being members of the same group.
Don’t worry if you did not understand all of that right now: just file away the idea that clustering can be
used in preprocessing. And if you really can’t wait, feel free to flip to [Link to Come] now.
